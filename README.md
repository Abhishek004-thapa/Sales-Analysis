# `Sales-Analysis`

## `Abstract :`

This project mainly focuses on small part of Machine Learning i.e Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA). It deals with tools and techniques for the analysis of our sales datasets so that appropriate bussiness strategy can be implemented and gain as much as profit in future. Main feature of this project is that i have implemented APRIORI ALGORITHM using APYORI Library for frequent Itemsets Generation and Association Rule Mining.

## `DATASETS`: https://www.kaggle.com/code/knightbearr/analysis-sales-data-knightbearr/data

## `STEPS :`
1) Importing Libraries and Loading Datasets.

2) Data Preprocessing & Preparing Datasets.

3) Exploratoty Data Analysis(EDA) & Visualization.

    I) Determining Top 3 Months with Maximum and Minimum Sales in 2019.

   II) Top 3 Cities with Maximum  and Minimum Sales in year 2019

  III) Mining Best Time to Display Advertisements to Maximize the Sales.

       - `Analyzing Specific City Sales vs Hour Line Plots`

   IV) Top 5-Most Ordered /Sold Product

    V) Market Basket Analysis- `Apriori Algorithm & Association Rule Mining.`
